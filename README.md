created by Jason, Marlena, Jane, and Dorit

Site for sharing study materials from helpful links to scans of worksheets

Spring Break Work!!:

Dorit: Make the dictionary that saves all of the files, other backendy stuff, also draw a picture of the cloud thing for Jane so that she knows what she is doing

Jason: stuff

Marlena: other stuff

Jane: Work on CSS and cleaning up HTML pages, figure out how to make the timeline work (our fancy thing that might use SVG and will look like a cloud [Dorit has to explain to me what this cloud thing is/draw me a picture]), maybe some Flasky things

ALSO we need to figure out how we're going to add people to certain groups, like whether they're going to require someone's approval or something

Hey it's Marlena. I don't think we need to have "classmates" and stuff. Everything should be public and accessible to everyone. There's no point to having a "members" list unless there is some way to contact them, and then we would need to create a way to chat or something.
ALSO we need to agree as to whether this is only within Stuy (for now) or across multiple schools.
