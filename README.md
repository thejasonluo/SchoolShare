Site for sharing study materials from helpful links to scans of worksheets

Spring Break Work!!:

Dorit: Make the dictionary that saves all of the files, other backendy stuff, also draw a picture of the cloud thing for Jane so that she knows what she is doing

Jason: stuff

Marlena: other stuff

Jane: Work on CSS and cleaning up HTML pages, figure out how to make the timeline work (our fancy thing that might use SVG and will look like a cloud [Dorit has to explain to me what this cloud thing is/draw me a picture]), maybe some Flasky things
