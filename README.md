SchoolShare
===========

created by Jason, Marlena, Jane, and Dorit

Site for sharing study materials from helpful links to scans of worksheets\

We spoke with Mr. Zamansky on how to code the upload files stuff, and basically in the Template you make a form with the type = file, and then in flask you have this whole thing where it saves the file etc, he sent us an email with sample code so Jane and I will forward it to you and that part is good. 


ALSO we need to figure out how we're going to add people to certain groups, like whether they're going to require someone's approval or something

Hey it's Marlena. I don't think we need to have "classmates" and stuff. Everything should be public and accessible to everyone. There's no point to having a "members" list unless there is some way to contact them, and then we would need to create a way to chat or something.
ALSO we need to agree as to whether this is only within Stuy (for now) or across multiple schools. 


I think it should be for all schools! Itll be really simple. Every school will have its own School Profile, and within that school profile you could have a list of all the classes and then people would be able to find their classes/use this application for real.


WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE TIMELINE THING. 


How I imagine it:

Date Class Page was Created <--------------------------------------------------> Present Date

As you scroll over the timeline, you would see when different study materials were uploaded. 

Potentially use http://timeline.knightlab.com/ ??

List of HTML Pages:
-Home
-Login
-Register
-Subjects
-Classes
   -(most likely) Classes2
   -i.e: subject = Biology
         classes = APBio, Geology, Environmental Science
         classes2 = list of all the study guides for one of the classes above
-Submit Page
   -Confirmation/Failure
   
   
   
HI GUYS:
So to print the documents on each page, Jane and I thought we could use this website.
http://viewerjs.org/instructions/

Maybe look into it a little??

^^ working on it. downloaded the file in static but might have to move it to the top folder later -marlena

ALSO: Someone please figure out how to use the google spreadsheets API
